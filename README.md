# toasty-note
Raspberry Pi-powered note taking program, compatible with email and camera. 

So far, only a very limited camera function is available for use with
the Raspberry Pi camera and Raspberry Pi board (1, 2, or 3).  

I'm a really novice programmer, and I'm trying really hard to make a good
note-taking program for school purposes, and for the experience. 
As such, development may be horribly slow and clunky, and I might just
be terrible at this. But even so, if you want to contribute to the project,
feel free to! Contact me at theadam43@gmail.com if you have any questions
or big additions to make.
