# toasty-note
Raspberry Pi-powered note taking program, compatible with email and camera. 

toasty-note is written in Python 3.4. 
So far, only a very limited camera function is available for use with
the Raspberry Pi camera and Raspberry Pi board (1, 2, or 3).

Toasty-Note itself is usable with any computer that runs python directly.
Later I will attempt to make this into full executable files for other
OS's.
